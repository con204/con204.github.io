      <description>Meshifying with AWS App Mesh (Part 1)   Meshifying with AWS App Mesh (Part 2)   At re:invent 2018, we announced AWS App Mesh, a service mesh that provides application-level networking to make it easy for your services to communicate with each other across multiple types of compute infrastructure. AWS App Mesh standardizes how your services communicate, giving you end-to-end visibility and ensuring high-availability for your applications.
Service meshes like AWS App Mesh help you to run and monitor HTTP and TCP services at scale.</description>
