      <description>Meshifying with AWS App Mesh (Part 1)   Meshifying with AWS App Mesh (Part 2)   At re:invent 2018, we announced AWS App Mesh, a service mesh that provides application-level networking to make it easy for your services to communicate with each other across multiple types of compute infrastructure. AWS App Mesh standardizes how your services communicate, giving you end-to-end visibility and ensuring high-availability for your applications.
Service meshes like AWS App Mesh help you to run and monitor HTTP and TCP services at scale.</description>

      <description>Flagger is a progressive delivery tool that automates the release process for applications running on Kubernetes. Flagger can be configured to automate the release process for Kubernetes workloads with a custom resource named canary.
We saw in the Canary chapter of Service Mesh using App Mesh workshop on how to deploy new version of detail service by changing the VirtualRouter configuration. In this workshop, we will show you how to use Flagger in App Mesh to automate the canary deployment of backend service detail of our Product Catalog Application.</description>
